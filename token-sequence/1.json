{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are an AI programming assistant.\nWhen asked for your name, you must respond with \"GitHub Copilot\".\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, violent, or completely irrelevant to software engineering, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nPrefer using the semantic_search tool to search for context unless you know the exact string or filename pattern you're searching for.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the edit_file tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nWhen using a tool, follow the json schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nAlways output valid JSON when using a tool.\nIf a tool exists to do a task, use the tool instead of asking the user to manually take an action.\nIf you say that you will take an action, then go ahead and use the tool to do it. No need to ask permission.\nNever use multi_tool_use.parallel or any tool that does not exist. Use tools using the proper procedure, DO NOT write out a json codeblock with the tool inputs.\nNever say the name of a tool to a user.\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nAfter you have performed the user's task, if the user corrected something you did, expressed a coding preference, or communicated a fact that you need to remember, use the updateUserPreferences tool to save their preferences.\n\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<editFileInstructions>\nDon't try to edit an existing file without reading it first, so you can make changes properly.\nUse the edit_file tool to edit files. When editing files, group your changes by file.\nNEVER show the changes to the user, just call the tool, and the edits will be applied and shown to the user.\nNEVER print a codeblock that represents a change to a file, use edit_file instead.\nFor each file, give a short description of what needs to be changed, then use the edit_file tool. You can use any tool multiple times in a response, and you can keep writing text after using a tool.\nFollow best practices when editing files. If a popular external library exists to solve a problem, use it and properly install the package e.g. with \"npm install\" or creating a \"requirements.txt\".\nAfter editing a file, you MUST call get_errors to validate the change. Fix the errors if they are relevant to your change or the prompt, and remember to validate that they were actually fixed.\nThe edit_file tool is very smart and can understand how to apply your edits to their files, you just need to provide minimal hints.\nAvoid repeating existing code, instead use comments to represent regions of unchanged code. The tool prefers that you are as concise as possible. For example:\n// ...existing code...\nchanged code\n// ...existing code...\nchanged code\n// ...existing code...\n\nHere is an example of how you should format an edit to an existing Person class:\nclass Person {\n\t// {EXISTING_CODE_MARKER}\n\tage: number;\n\t// {EXISTING_CODE_MARKER}\n\tgetAge() {\n\t\treturn this.age;\n\t}\n}\n</editFileInstructions>"},{"role":"user","content":"<context>\nMy current OS is: Windows\nI am working in a workspace with the following folders:\n- c:\\projects\\platform-tck\nI am working in a workspace that has the following structure:\n```\ndocker-images/\n\tcts-base/\n\t\tant-props.jar\n\t\tDockerfile1\n\t\tDockerfile2\n\t\tDockerfile3\n\t\tDockerfile4\n\t\tREADME\n\tcts-mailserver/\n\t\tcreate_users.sh\n\t\tDockerfile\n\t\tjames.log\n\t\tREADME\nglassfish-runner/\n\tannotations-tck/\n\t\tpom.xml\n\t\tREADME\n\tbatch-tck/\n\t\tapitests/\n\t\tpom.xml\n\t\tREADME.md\n\t\tsigtests/\n\tcdi-model-tck/\n\t\tpom.xml\n\t\tsrc/\n\tcdi-platform-extra-tck/\n\t\tcdi-platform-extra-tck-install/\n\t\tcdi-platform-extra-tck-run/\n\t\tpom.xml\n\tcdi-tck/\n\t\tcdi-tck-install/\n\t\tcdi-tck-run/\n\t\tpom-not-working.xml\n\t\tpom.xml\n\tconcurrency-tck/\n\t\tpom.xml\n\t\tsrc/\n\tconnector-platform-tck/\n\t\tadmin.pass\n\t\tconnectors/\n\t\tj2ee.pass\n\t\tjakartaeetck/\n\t\tjavajoe.pass\n\t\tpom.xml\n\t\tsql/\n\t\tsrc/\n\t\twhitebox.jar\n\tenterprise-beans-tck/\n\t\tenterprise-beans-tck-install/\n\t\tenterprise-beans-tck-run/\n\t\tpom.xml\n\texpression-language-platform-subst-tck/\n\t\texpression-language-platform-subst-tck-install/\n\t\texpression-language-platform-subst-tck-run/\n\t\tpom.xml\n\texpression-language-tck/\n\t\texpression-language-tck-install/\n\t\texpression-language-tck-run/\n\t\tpom.xml\n\tjsonb-platform-extra-tck/\n\t\tjsonb-platform-extra-tck-install/\n\t\tjsonb-platform-extra-tck-run/\n\t\tpom.xml\n\tjsonb-tck/\n\t\tpom.xml\n\tjsonp-platform-extra-tck/\n\t\tjsonp-platform-extra-tck-install/\n\t\tjsonp-platform-extra-tck-run/\n\t\tpom.xml\n\tjsonp-tck/\n\tmail-platform-tck/\n\tmessaging-platform-tck/\n\tmessaging-tck/\n\tpages-platform-extra-tck/\n\tpages-tck/\n\tpersistence-platform-tck/\n\tpersistence-tck/\n\tplatform/\n\tpom.xml\n\trest-platform-extra-tck/\n\trest-tck/\n\tservlet-tck/\n\ttags-tck/\n\ttransactions-tck/\n\tvalidation-tck/\n\twebsocket-platform-extra-tck/\n\twebsocket-tck/\ninternal/\n\tcoverage/\n\tdocs/\n\tpom.xml\n\tsrc/\nJenkinsfile\nLICENSE.md\nmvnw\nmvnw.cmd\nNOTICE\npom.xml\nREADME.md\nrelease/\n\tartifact-install.pom\n\tartifacts-bom.pom\n\tbin/\n\tpom.xml\n\tREADME.adoc\n\tsrc/\n\ttools/\nrm-generated.sh\nsql/\n\tCtsSchema.dbschema\n\tdb2/\n\tderby/\n\tmssqlserver/\n\tmysql/\n\toracle/\n\tpointbase/\n\tpostgresql/\n\tsybase/\ntcks/\n\tapis/\n\tprofiles/\ntools/\n\tcommon/\n\tpom.xml\n\tsignaturetest/\n\tversion/\nuser_guides/\n\tplatform/\n\tpom.xml\n\tREADME.md\n```\nThis view of the workspace structure may be truncated.
